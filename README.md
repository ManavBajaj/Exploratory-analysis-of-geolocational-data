The Geolocational Data Analysis App is a Streamlit-based interactive web application that helps users visualize and analyze food-related venues near apartment locations using geospatial clustering. Built with Python and powered by libraries like Pandas, Geopy, and Folium, the app provides spatial insights ideal for students, urban planners, and businesses.


Key Features

-Geolocation-Based Clustering: Uses K-Means, Hierarchical, and Affinity Propagation algorithms to analyze venue distribution near apartment clusters.

-Dynamic Map Visualizations: Displays results on interactive maps with Folium.

-User-Centered Interface: Simple, clean UI for entering coordinates and triggering analysis.

-Multi-Algorithm Support: Switch between different clustering approaches with real-time execution.

-Streamlit Integration: Seamlessly built for web interaction with real-time feedback.


How It Works

1.Users enter the location name or latitude/longitude in the app.

2.The system geocodes the coordinates using Geopy.

3.Chosen clustering algorithms segment the data into distinct venue-based clusters.

4.Results are visualized on a map, and box plots provide deeper analytical insights.

5.Users can compare clusters and export results if needed.


Use Cases

-Assisting students in selecting ideal apartments based on nearby food/grocery options

-Supporting urban planners in identifying food deserts or underserved areas

-Helping businesses find strategic locations for new outlets
